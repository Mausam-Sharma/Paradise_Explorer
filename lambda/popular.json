The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities of fishing colonies. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and subsequently to the British East India Company. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped with the construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Upon India’s independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Sanyukta Maharashtra movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital. The city was renamed Mumbai in 1996. And in this short period of development, the city has transformed into the commercial and entertainment capital of India."

Fort St. George that serves as the Government Secretariat today, was built to set up a factory serving as a nucleus for British settlements. The city was known as Madras till 1996 and later renamed as Chennai. Today this buoyant metropolis is a blend of the old and the new, the traditional and the modern. Spread over 200 sq km with the Bay of Bengal on the east, the city is the gateway to the rest of South India."
